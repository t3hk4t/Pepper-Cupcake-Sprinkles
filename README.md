Conclusion - if you have no experience in android programming, one must certainly go through the android studio tutorials. Here is a link: [Build your first app | Android Basics | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp)
It is also recommended that you have theoretical knowledge about activities, fragments, async, sync method calls etc... 
Before starting any pepper robot programming, make sure that you know pepper principles. [Mastering Focus & Robot lifecycle — QiSDK (softbankrobotics.com)](https://qisdk.softbankrobotics.com/sdk/doc/pepper-sdk/ch2_principles/focus_lifecycle.html)

Once you know basic the terminology and architecture of the basic android app, then you can move on the programming Pepper. During our reserach sessions, we could not make an empty project and run it from this tutorial [Creating a robot application — QiSDK (softbankrobotics.com)](https://qisdk.softbankrobotics.com/sdk/doc/pepper-sdk/ch1_gettingstarted/starting_project.html). Either because of android devlopment illeteracy or some Pepper SDK bugs. Either way we concluded that using SoftBank SDK template is good enough for us. You can find a template : [softbankrobotics-labs/App-Template: This is a general structure of an android application built for Pepper. (github.com)](https://github.com/softbankrobotics-labs/App-Template). 

We tested few basic things like Say action [Say — QiSDK (aldebaran.com)](https://android.aldebaran.com/sdk/doc/pepper-sdk/ch4_api/conversation/reference/say.html), playing a sound on the robot [audio - Play sound on button click android - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18459122/play-sound-on-button-click-android)
